# Steps to produce wordcloud image above 
Here are the steps to produce the wordcloud image above: 
1. You need to create a github site that has [requirements.txt](test.dir) file. 
2. Go to https://mybinder.org/ and in the Github repository name blank enter https://github.com/daniel-m7/bible-wordcloud.
3. Click the Launch button. This will create a notebook by first loading the import modules from [requirements.txt](test.dir).
4. After the noteook is loaded, you can run the notebook to produce the wordcloud image above.
