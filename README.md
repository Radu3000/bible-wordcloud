# Word Cloud for First Epistle of John
I used mybinder.com data science workbench that saves data science notebooks to github to produce the following image:

!
# Five steps to reproduce the wordcloud image above 
Here are the steps to produce the wordcloud image above: 
1. Right click on this github site https://github.com/daniel-m7/bible-wordcloud and choose "Copy link address"
2. Right click on this link: https://mybinder.org/ and choose "Open link in new tab"
3. Select the new tab and paste the copied link in the "**Github repository name or URL**" text field
4. Click the "**Launch**" button. This will create a Jupyter data science workbench.  
**Note:** It will take a minute for all import modules in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to be made available and then the workbench is displayed
5. After the workbench is loaded open and run each step of the **1 John Word Cloud.ipynb** notebook to produce the wordcloud image above.
*Note: any changes you make to the notebook will NOT get saved to this github site.  If you want to save changes you can download the notebook and corresponding files and create a similar github sit*
