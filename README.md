I used mybinder.com data science workbench that saves data science notebooks to github to produce the following image:

# Steps to produce wordcloud image above 
Here are the steps to produce the wordcloud image above: 
1. Go to https://mybinder.org/ and in the **Github repository name blank** enter the URL of this site https://github.com/daniel-m7/bible-wordcloud.
2. Click the **Launch** button. This will create a Jupyter data science workbench by first loading the import modules from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
3. After the notebook is loaded, you can run the notebook [1JohnWordCloud.ipynb](1JohnWordCloud.ipynb) to produce the wordcloud image above.
