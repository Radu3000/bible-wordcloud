# Word Cloud for First Epistle of John
I used mybinder.com data science workbench that saves data science notebooks to github to produce the following image: 
![alt text](1john-wordcloud.png?raw=true)
!
# Steps to produce wordcloud image above 
Here are the steps to produce the wordcloud image above: 
1. Copy to the clipboard the link to this github site https://github.com/daniel-m7/bible-wordcloud
2. Go to https://mybinder.org/ and in the "**Github repository name text field**" paste the link
3. Click the "**Launch**" button. This will create a Jupyter data science workbench.  
**Note:** It will take a minute for all import modules in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to be made available and then the workbench is displayed.
4. After the workbench is loaded open and run each step of the **1 John Word Cloud.ipynb** notebook to produce the wordcloud image above.
