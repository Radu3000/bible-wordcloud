# Word Cloud for First Epistle of John
I used mybinder.com data science workbench that saves data science notebooks to github to produce the following image:

# Steps to produce wordcloud image above 
Here are the steps to produce the wordcloud image above: 
1. Go to https://mybinder.org/ and in the "**Github repository name text field**" enter the URL of this site https://github.com/daniel-m7/bible-wordcloud
2. Click the "**Launch**" button. This will create a Jupyter data science workbench.  
**Note:** Once you click Launch button import modules from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) are loaded first then the workbench is displayed a few seconds later.
3. After the workbench is loaded open and run each step of the **1 John Word Cloud.ipynb** notebook to produce the wordcloud image above.
